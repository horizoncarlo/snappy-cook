- Create an app for my wife to store recipes and more importantly automatically meal plan
- Add food (Name, Notes [as HTML]), multi-select checkbox for Tags
- Manage Tags - chip list to manage, arbitrary text, no duplicates allowed
- Table of all foods - search, sort, filter, etc.
- Meal Plan
  - 1 week at a time only	
  - Choose tags for each day, so you can say "Chicken" and "Mexican" on a Tuesday, and it'll ONLY randomize between those foods
- Authenticate is simple, just a password like old torrent downloader app. Auto-remembers login. Can view without authentication

- React for work related learning?
- Next.js too
- Shoelace components just for some spice? Sure beats MUI
- Try SimpleMDE for a Markdown editor (https://simplemde.com/)
- Could use json-server and lowdb for storage?

**Will have to update Thorn nginx config to allow multiple apps, but we've been wanting to do that for a while anyway**
